A modern To-Do List application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This app allows users to add, delete, and reorder tasks using drag-and-drop. Tasks are stored in localStorage, so your list persists across browser sessions.

Delete tasks: Remove individual tasks with a single click.

Clear all tasks: Remove all tasks at once with a dedicated button.

Drag-and-drop reordering: Rearrange tasks easily by dragging them.

Persistent storage: Tasks are saved in localStorage and restored on page reload.

Responsive design: Looks great on mobile and desktop.

Modern UI: Built with Tailwind CSS and supports gradients, shadows, and interactive elements.
